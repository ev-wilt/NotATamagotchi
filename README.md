NotATamagatchi is a virtual pet game inspired by the hit 90's toy Tamagotchi. 
It is written in Python and uses tkinter for the GUI elements.

The goal of the game is to keep your pet alive by playing with it and feeding it.
If your pet gets sick, their happiness and hunger will momentarily drain even faster, so be careful!
If your pet starves or becomes too sad, they die and the game is over.

Known Bugs: The game over screen ocassionally displays the wrong ascii art.
